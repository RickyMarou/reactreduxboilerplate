# Another simple react/redux boilerplate

Basically a fork of [this](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) boilerplate made by [Stephen Grider](https://twitter.com/ste_grider).

Just removed the test librairies and folder and added [responsive-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/responsive-components) by [Romain Preston](https://twitter.com/romain_preston)
